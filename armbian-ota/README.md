# Armbian OTA Support

This extension provides two different OTA (Over-The-Air) update mechanisms for Armbian:

1. **Recovery OTA** - Single partition recovery mode (existing implementation)
2. **AB Partition OTA** - Dual partition A/B update mode with automatic rollback

Note: When `OTA_ENABLE=yes`, OTA runtime is installed into the firmware by mode:
- `AB_PART_OTA=yes`: install AB OTA runtime/tools.
- without `AB_PART_OTA`: install Recovery OTA runtime/tools.

```

The build hooks install `common/rootfs` first, then install the selected mode
overlay with `rsync`.  Files under each `rootfs/` directory therefore mirror
their final paths in the image.

## Recovery OTA Mode

### Configuration

Set these environment variables to enable Recovery OTA:

```bash
OTA_ENABLE=yes
# Do not set AB_PART_OTA
```

### Partition Layout

| Partition | Label | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| nvme0n1p1 | armbi_boot | `/boot` files (ext4, plain mode) |
| nvme0n1p2 | (security) | crypto key material (encrypted modes only) |
| nvme0n1p2 or p3 | armbi_root | rootfs (LUKS+ext4 in auto-decrypt mode) |
| last | armbi_usrdata | overlayfs upper layer + OTA transaction store |

Plain recovery:
```
[ boot ext4 ][ rootfs ext4 ][ userdata ext4 ]
```

Auto-decrypt recovery (RK_OPTEE_BOOT_ENABLE=yes):
```
[ boot ext4 ][ security ][ rootfs LUKS+ext4 ][ userdata LUKS+ext4 ]
```

Secure boot recovery (RK_SECURE_UBOOT_ENABLE=yes, BOOT_RAW_MODE=yes):
```
[ boot raw FIT ][ security ][ rootfs LUKS+ext4 ][ userdata LUKS+ext4 ]
```

The `/boot` partition is **never** overlayed. The runtime fstab mounts it on
top of overlayfs, so any process writing to `/boot` (apt kernel upgrades,
manual `armbianEnv.txt` edits, OTA tooling) hits the real boot partition —
U-Boot reads the same bytes on next boot. This avoids the prior failure
mode where `/boot` writes were captured by the overlayfs upper layer on
userdata and were invisible to U-Boot.

The boot partition size can be tuned with `OTA_BOOT_SIZE` (default 256 MiB).

### How It Works

1. OTA package is extracted to `userdata/ota-recovery/ota_work/`
2. Initramfs hooks are installed and `update-initramfs` is executed
3. On reboot, initramfs applies OTA payload to current rootfs
4. A separate userdata partition supplies persistent overlays for `/etc`,
   `/home`, and `/var/lib`
5. System reboots into updated firmware

### Usage

```bash
# On target system
armbian-ota start <path-to-ota-package.tar.gz>
reboot
```

## AB Partition OTA Mode

### Configuration

Set this environment variable to enable AB Partition OTA:

```bash
OTA_ENABLE=yes
AB_PART_OTA=yes
```

**Important**: AB OTA and Recovery OTA are mutually exclusive. You cannot enable both at the same time.

### Partition Layout

| Partition | Label | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| nvme0n1p1 | armbi_boota | Boot slot A |
| nvme0n1p2 | armbi_bootb | Boot slot B |
| nvme0n1p3 | armbi_roota | Root slot A |
| nvme0n1p4 | armbi_rootb | Root slot B |
| nvme0n1p5 | armbi_usrdata | User data (shared) |

### Persistent Data

User data survives OTA updates differently depending on the OTA mode.

User account database files (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/group`,
`/etc/gshadow`, `/etc/subuid`, `/etc/subgid`) remain normal files in the
overlay filesystem. This is required because tools such as `useradd` and
`groupadd` update those files by writing a temporary file and renaming it over
the original.

Both OTA modes use overlayroot with the final `userdata` partition as the
writable upper layer. The rootfs is the read-only lower layer, so runtime
writes—including `/home` and `/var/lib`—persist on `armbi_usrdata` without
changing the OTA rootfs. Encrypted A/B and Recovery images use the
initramfs-unlocked `/dev/mapper/armbian-userdata` mapper as the overlayroot
backing device.

In Recovery mode the dedicated `/boot` partition is the **one exception**
to overlayfs: it is mounted by fstab on top of the overlay root, so writes
to `/boot` reach the real boot partition and stay visible to U-Boot across
reboots. This matters for apt kernel upgrades and `armbianEnv.txt` edits,
which would otherwise be captured by the overlay upper layer and silently
ignored on next boot.

Recovery OTA stores its pending payload and state in `userdata/ota-recovery/`
rather than the overlay rootfs. The initramfs mounts this transaction store,
rewrites only the raw rootfs lower layer, and leaves userdata intact.

Neither OTA mode migrates data from older single-rootfs Recovery images;
this layout is intended for new development images.

On first boot, `armbian-resize-userdata.service` expands the final `userdata`
partition to use available disk space in both modes. For encrypted A/B and
Recovery images, it logs that a reboot is required after expanding the
partition. The next boot reopens the `armbian-userdata` LUKS mapper at its new
size, then expands its inner ext4 filesystem.

### U-Boot Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `boot_slot` | Current active slot (a or b) |
| `boot_success` | Last successfully booted slot |
| `ota_in_progress` | OTA in progress flag (0 or 1) |

### How It Works

1. User initiates OTA with `armbian-ota start <package>`
2. OTA payload is copied to target (inactive) slot partitions
3. `ota_in_progress=1` and `boot_slot` are set to target slot
4. System reboots
5. System boots from target slot
7. Health checks run on first boot
8. If checks pass: OTA marked successful, `ota_in_progress=0`
9. If checks fail: Automatic rollback to previous slot

### Usage

```bash
# Check status
armbian-ota status

# Start OTA update
armbian-ota start Armbian_xxx-OTA.tar.gz

# System will reboot and apply update automatically

# Manually switch to the other boot slot after OTA has completed
armbian-ota switch-slot
```

## Build Configuration

Add to your board configuration or build command:

```bash
# For AB Partition OTA
OTA_ENABLE=yes
AB_PART_OTA=yes
OTA_BOOT_SIZE=256       # Boot partition size in MiB
# OTA_ROOTFS_SIZE=4096  # Optional rootfs partition size override
OTA_USERDATA_SIZE=1024  # Userdata partition size in MiB
OTA_SECURITY_SIZE=4     # Security partition size in MiB (encrypted images)

# For Recovery OTA
OTA_ENABLE=yes
# leave AB_PART_OTA unset
OTA_BOOT_SIZE=256       # /boot partition size in MiB (ext4 except secure boot)
# OTA_ROOTFS_SIZE=4096  # Optional rootfs partition size override
OTA_USERDATA_SIZE=1024  # Userdata partition size in MiB
OTA_SECURITY_SIZE=4     # Security partition size in MiB (encrypted images)
```

When unset, `OTA_ROOTFS_SIZE` is calculated from the built rootfs size plus
`EXTRA_ROOTFS_MIB_SIZE`, then adds 30% headroom. The same size-variable
policy applies to both A/B and Recovery OTA modes.

Both OTA modes require a GPT partition table. Their boot, rootfs, userdata,
and security partitions are located by GPT partition labels.
Both OTA layouts boot through U-Boot and do not include BIOS or UEFI
partitions.

## OTA Package Contents

The OTA package (`*-OTA.tar.gz`) contains:

- `rootfs.tar.gz` - Root filesystem image (required)
- `rootfs.sha256` - Root filesystem checksum (required)
- `boot.tar.gz` - Boot partition image (optional)
- `boot.sha256` - Boot partition checksum (optional)
- `package.env` - OTA mode and package metadata
- `boot.itb` - FIT boot image (for secure boot)
- `version.txt` - Image name, version, build commit, and extension commit

The package does not include an offline `ota_tools/` bundle; the required OTA
runtime is installed into the firmware at image build time.

## Troubleshooting

### Check OTA Status

```bash
armbian-ota status
```

### View Logs

```bash
# OTA manager logs
cat /var/log/armbian-ota/ota.log

# Health check logs
cat /var/log/armbian-ota/health-check.log

# Initramfs logs
cat /run/initramfs/ab-ota.log
```

### Automatic Rollback

Rollback is triggered by `armbian-ota-rollback.service` if first boot health checks fail during A/B OTA verification.
Use `armbian-ota switch-slot [a|b]` for manual slot maintenance after OTA has completed.

### A/B Boot State

Non-secure A/B images store boot state in the fixed raw U-Boot environment
offset (`0x3f8000`, size `0x8000`) on the selected boot disk.  This works the
same way for SD, eMMC, and NVMe images. The A/B backend uses an internal
helper to manage this `fw_setenv` state.

Filesystem A/B images package U-Boot's complete compiled default environment
and merge the A/B variables into `/etc/u-boot-initial-env`. On the first
boot, U-Boot uses its compiled default environment; the runtime then creates
the persistent environment with `fw_setenv -f`. This prevents that
initialization from discarding commands such as `distro_bootcmd` and
`scan_dev_for_boot`.

For Secure Boot A/B packages, the A/B backend verifies `boot.itb` and writes
it directly to the inactive raw `boot_a` or `boot_b` partition. It never
mounts a FIT boot partition or treats the FIT image as `boot.tar.gz`.
When automatic rootfs decryption is enabled, both A/B modes create a shared
`security` partition and format both rootfs slots as LUKS-backed ext4.
Slot-state transitions use the A/B backend's internal U-Boot environment
helper.

### Check U-Boot Environment

```bash
fw_printenv
fw_printenv -n boot_slot
fw_printenv -n ota_in_progress
```

### Set U-Boot Environment Manually

```bash
fw_setenv boot_slot a
fw_setenv boot_success a
fw_setenv ota_in_progress 0
```
